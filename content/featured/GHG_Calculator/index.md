Online Platform for estimation of GHG emissions for construction of roads.
Implemented a full stack solution for estimation of carbon footprint for different HMA and PCC pavement
sections based on 5+ parameters and added feature for quantifiable recommendations on how the established
footprints can be used for the development of [green construction standards](https://www.wbdg.org/resources/green-building-standards-and-certification-systems).
